        Radiusâ€™ mission is to help people build stronger relationships with others in their everyday lives. Through our location-based social media app, we give our users the ability to connect with people that are actually around them; whether theyâ€™re travelling alone in a new area, at a party, or trying to meet people at work. Our goal is to help grow everyoneâ€™s social network as much as we can. ðŸ¥³
        <br><br>
        As a UCLA-based startup, weâ€™re building a close-knit team of talented individuals who thrive in a fast-paced environment and want their work to have a large impact on the product. They enjoy building strong personal relationships and are passionate about helping others grow.

        Weâ€™re looking for an extremely entrepreneurial Director of Customer Strategy that is passionate about helping students (particularly freshmen new to college) build the social network they need to succeed in school and beyond, and is interested in the opportunity to establish and grow a user base from its basic foundations. Ideal candidates are interested in pursuing a future career in Product Management or Management Consulting, and want the experience to prove they have what it takes to succeed in these areas. This position has flexible hours and would preferably require presence at UCLA, however remote work can be discussed.
